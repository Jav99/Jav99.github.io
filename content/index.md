**Demo critique 1:** Your bullet points describe tasks, not results. Hiring managers want to see revenue generated, costs saved, or teams scaled—not processes followed.

**Demo critique 2:** The career narrative lacks a clear upward trajectory. Your most impressive role is buried below less relevant positions.

**Demo critique 3:** Corporate jargon like 'synergized cross-functional teams' dilutes your authority. Replace with concrete, metric-driven language.

**Demo Hannah's Take:** You have strong fundamentals and real experience, but your resume reads like a job description, not a career highlight reel. With the right positioning, you're a top-quartile candidate.
